# AI-Connect-Four
CSE240 - Graduate Artificial Intelligence Course
By Christian Lei

This project was created for a graduate AI Course. The purpose of this code is to create a game of
connect four. We are playing against a zero-sum agent and a stocastic adversarial agent. The Alpha Beta Minimax Alg is used
to play the zero-sum agent while the Expectimax Algorithm is used to play the stochastic agent. 

Algorithims Implemeneted:
- Alpha Beta Minimax
- Expectimax
